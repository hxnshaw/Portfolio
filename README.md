This is the first individual project in the WeJapa internship,and we were asked to either create a tributes page,or a personal gallery page.

I chose the latter,and it was fun working on it. I'm not a big fan of taking personal pictures,so it was quite a task getting enough photographs of myself for this project.
(Funny right?).

The photographs are of different sizes,so the positioning mattered alot.

I arranged the photographs systematically to create a beautiful layout.

I am a big fan of minimal designs,and you can call me a minimalist, therefore I wanted something simple and effective.
And that is what I made essentially.

The code has comments in appropriate places,to help you better understand it.

To get the code on your PC,you can simply download the zip file to your device,and open it with your preferred code editor.
